        <p>This project was created as my submission for Enterprise Application Development CA3.</p>
        <p>
            The idea behind this project is to use the RAWG API to fetch data about video games, giving the user an interactive way to search and explore gaming titles.
        </p>
        <p>
            The API that I have chosen, being RAWG API, provides access to an extensive catalog of game data, including descriptions, release dates, and ratings, making it a great choice for this application.
